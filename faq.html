      <h2>Answers Youâ€™re Looking For</h2>

      <h3>Are you local to Vernal?</h3>
      <p>Yes. I live and work here. You can often find me at <span class="highlight">Smithâ€™s Pharmacy</span>, and Iâ€™m available for in-person help when you need it.</p>

      <h3>Why choose a local agent instead of signing up over the phone?</h3>
      <p>With unknown phone ads, you may never see that agent again. When you work with me, you get a local advocate who helps fix problems, reviews your plan each year, and is here when questions pop up.</p>

      <h3>If I change my mind, can you help me switch plans?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. Itâ€™s my job to help you find the right plan and, when Medicare rules allow, move you to it. I handle the forms and follow-through so changes go smoothly.</p>

      <h3>Can I come back to you for anything?</h3>
      <p>Please do. Plan rules, bills, prior authorizations, drug lists, doctors in-networkâ€”bring it all. Iâ€™ll help you sort it out.</p>

      <h3>What if I change my plan with another agent?</h3>
      <p>When a client switches through another agent, I often receive a <span class="highlight">chargeback</span>. Iâ€™m trying to make an honest living here in Vernal, and I truly appreciate clients who come back to meâ€”Iâ€™ll give you that same honesty and effort in return.</p>

      <h3>Do you help with Medicaid and the Low-Income Subsidy (Extra Help)?</h3>
      <p>Yes. I can help you apply for Utah Medicaid and Extra Help (LIS), which can lower your monthly drug plan premium and reduce prescription costs.</p>

      <h3>Can you help with medications and copay grants?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Iâ€™ll search for manufacturer patient-assistance programs and charitable copay foundations and help you apply when theyâ€™re available for your medications.</p>

      <h3>What does it cost to work with you?</h3>
      <p>Thereâ€™s no extra cost to you. Iâ€™m paid by the plan you choose. Your trust and coming back to me lets me keep serving you all year longâ€”thank you.</p>

      <h3>How do we meet?</h3>
      <p>We can meet at Smithâ€™s Pharmacy, your home, by phone, or onlineâ€”whatever is easiest for you. Call or email to set a time.</p>
